## Getting Started

### Invite Yeoman

Not every new computer comes with a Yeoman pre-installed. He lives in the [npm](https://npmjs.org) package repository. You only have to ask for him once, then he packs up and moves into your hard drive. *Make sure you clean up, he likes new and shiny things.*

```
$ npm install -g yo
```

### ChromeApp Coffee Generator

Install `generator-chromeapp-coffee`:

```
npm install -g generator-chromeapp-coffee
```

Make a new directory and `cd` into it:

```
mkdir my-shiny-project && cd $_
```

Finally, initiate the generator:

```
$ yo chromeapp-coffee
```
